The first phase of the project is (almost) completely done in PLINK
First of all you need to import the genotypic data into a folder, and open the console

Useful functions:
head filname: used to explore the first rows of a file
more filename: used to explore more lines of a file. to exit you must go to the end + can't go back
less filename: used to go back in the exploration, you can move back to the starting point
cut: used to cut something inside the file:
  example: cut -f 3 filename will cut the third column from the file
sort: will order the informations
  sort -u: will order and eliminate the duplicate 
  sort -u -n: will order, eliminate the duplicate and order on numerical order
nano: will open the text editor
ls -lht: will show in chronological order the files present in the directory
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Let's start: opening the terminal straight from the folder with the dataset is useful, 
but you can define the WD later

cut -f 3 sample_all_snp.txt |sort -u : with this code you will extract from the .txt file the third column, 
                                       and it will order the result:
Palestinian
Bedouin
Druze
Sardinian
French
Han
Yoruba
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
now, with nano, let's create a .txt file called pops.txt, in which there is the list of the interest populations
just insert the name of the populations, then CTRL + O to save and CTRL + X to exit

grep -w -f pops.txt sample_all_snp.txt > samples.txt

command grep will research precise pattern in a text file and will return all rows in which appears the pattern 
-w: the pattern must be a word
-f: pattern must be contained into the following file, in this case pops.txt
> --> the output of the operation will be saved in a new file
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
now we should check if everything is working properly

cut -f 3 samples.txt |sort -u

there is an error! Han-NChina population appears, but this is an error, so:

grep -v 'NChina' samples.txt > samples_last.txt

-v is used to maintain everything as it is when researched pattern 'NChina' is not found, 
and a new file is created. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Now we want to extract in a new file the first column:

cut -f 1 samples_last.txt > temp.txt

and we will paste it into samples_last:

paste temp.txt samples_last.txt > subset.txt

Subset is our new file, ready to be used into PLINK. Its structure is the same as the HGDP file from the beginning
however, we are doubling the first column in order to let the file to be used by PLINK. 
At this point, subset.txt contains the list of the samples we want to extract from the entire HGDP dataset

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

plink --bfile HGDP --keep subset.txt --make-bed --out mydata

--bfile is used to suggest a triplet of .bed, .bim, .fam
--keep will specify the individuals to be maintained
--make-bed will create a new file triplet
--out is needed to specify how to name the files

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We are interested in knowing to which chromosome the SNPs are belonging:

cut -f 1 mydata.bim |sort -u -n 

Now, we need to extract all chromosomes between 1 and 22, because we will work on autosomes, that are
missing on sexual chromosomes and mtDNA

cat mydata.bim |awk '$1<=22'| cut -f 2 > autosomes.txt

cat: catenate command, will transfer text file within mydata.bim to awk operator thanks to the pipeline|
awk: more than a simple command, it will verify on the first column $1 if condition <=22 is respected
