In this file there are notes about my lessons of Human Genomics (lab part). 
It is all based on a paper which is now well known for these methods. 
First of all, in order to properly run it, Ubuntu/Linux OS is needed. That's because usually you will work on servers. 
This method is based on different softwares, so there will also be some parts into R, especially for graphical representations.

These are the steps: 
1. preparation and manipulation of genomic data with PLINK;
2. PCA, in this case done to discover if there is a structure within the data we will use
3. Admixture analysis, a multivariate method used to discover if there is or not a gene flow between populations
4. F3 test: to formally test the admixture hypothesis
5. Alder, to date admixture events

Data:
we will use the Human Diversity Genome Progect (HGDP). This dataset was published in the first 2000s, 
it contains genomic informations of 1043 different individuals belonging to 51 populations spread worldwide

The dataset is composed by 3 different files: .bed, .bim, .fam + a text file
.fam extension is a text file which contain information on the individual of the sample and their genotype
